# Remote Hands

Hand raising for a distributed workplace of classroom!

## How to use it

Join a room, and share the name of the room or the URL with everyone attending. People can set a status, which will appear on others' devices so they can see when a hand is raised. There are also buttons for thumbs up/down for taking a quick poll, a speaker for "I'm having A/V problems" and a warning triangle for "There's a problem"!

## Change the reactions/add your own!

If you remixed this project, you can edit `src/reactions.js` to modify the list of reactions available to participants.
